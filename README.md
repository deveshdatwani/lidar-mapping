# Mapping

### Introduction

In the fall of 2022, I worked with the Worcester Fire Department, Worcester, MA to build a scalable mobile robot solution to assess fire safety of building floors. 

For this purpose, my team and I deployed the standard turtlebot packages such as move base and gmapping to achieve reasonable autonomy and slam.
